Description: We propose a tree-based reinforcement learning (T-RL) method to directly estimate optimal DTRs in a multi-stage multi-treatment setting. At each stage, T-RL builds an unsupervised decision tree that directly handles the problem of optimization with multiple treatment comparisons, through a purity measure constructed with augmented inverse probability weighted estimators.
